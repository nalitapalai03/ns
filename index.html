        <p>Dear Zindagi (transl. Dear life) is a 2016 Indian Hindi-language coming-of-age drama film written and directed by Gauri Shinde. It was produced by Gauri Khan, Karan Johar, and Shinde under the banners of Red Chillies Entertainment, Dharma Productions,
            and Hope Productions respectively. The film stars Alia Bhatt, with Shah Rukh Khan, Ira Dubey, Kunal Kapoor, Angad Bedi, Ali Zafar, Yashaswini Dayama and Rohit Suresh Saraf in supporting roles. The plot centres on a budding cinematographer
            who is discontented with her life and meets a free-spirited psychologist who helps her to gain a new perspective on her life. Development of the film began in 2015, when Shinde signed Bhatt and Khan for a film to be made under her banner.
            Principal photography took place in Goa and Mumbai, in the period from 21 January to 20 May 2016. The film features a score composed by Amit Trivedi and lyrics written mostly by Kausar Munir. Dear Zindagi released on 23 November 2016 in North
            America, two days before its worldwide release on 25 November 2016 and received positive reviews, with particular praise directed towards Bhatt's and Khan's performances. The film grossed ₹1.39 billion (US$19 million) at the box office. It
            received a number of nominations at Bollywood award ceremonies, but failed to win any.</p>

        <h3 style="color:black ">Plot</h3>
        <p>In Mumbai and Goa, Kaira is a promising cinematographer who wishes to direct her own films. Blunt and cynical, she is most comfortable when with her three best friends, Fatima, Jackie and Ganju. Kaira's life takes a downturn when Raghuvendra,
            a film producer for whom she breaks up with her childhood sweetheart, gets engaged to someone else. Her landlord then turns her out of her apartment because the building association wants to rent apartments only to married couples. All this
            plus dissatisfaction with her prospects at work serves as a catalyst for Kaira's shift to Goa, where she now has to grudgingly live with her parents with whom she has some issues. She ends up spending many sleepless nights in unhappiness and
            uncertainty. While in Goa, Kaira seeks out Dr. Jehangir "Jug " Khan, a psychologist, for her insomnia after inadvertently having heard him talk at a Mental Health Awareness Conference. She warms to Jug's unconventional methods, trying to use
            them to understand herself. Meanwhile, Kaira meets a musician, Rumi, and falls in love with him, but they break up before anything serious can happen when she realises they may not be the right fit for each other. During this time, Kaira reunites
            with her younger brother, Kiddo, who is the only other person besides her best friends that she is closest to. Matters with her family come to a head when Kaira has an outburst at a family get-together where she confronts her parents about
            them abandoning her for years at her grandparents' house. Kaira finally narrates the story of her abandonment to Jug, who tells her that she fears abandonment so much that she does not allow herself to commit in relationships, leaving before
            they can leave her. He convinces her that she does not need to forgive her parents for abandoning her in her childhood but as an adult, have the maturity to see them as two regular people who are capable of making mistakes, like everyone else.
            After this, Kaira makes an effort to reconcile with her parents and also works to finish her short film. At their last session, Kaira admits to Jug that she has grown to like and love him. Jug responds that it is normal for a patient to feel
            this way about their therapist and while he likes her platonically, a relationship would not be possible between them. The two share a hug before Kaira leaves. Kaira finally completes her short film, which she had been working on for years.
            At the premiere, her friends, family, and exes are present to cheer her on. This is where Kaira meets a furniture designer, and she continues on with her life.

        <p>Made on a moderate budget, Dear Zindagi was produced by Gauri Khan of Red Chillies Entertainment, Johar of Dharma Productions and Shinde of Hope Productions. The film was directed by Shinde, her second directorial after the comedy-drama film English
            Vinglish (2012). When Shinde was asked in an interview with The Indian Express, whether there is a personal story to Dear Zindagi, she replied, "Dear Zindagi is inspired by life in general. It started with an idea about the connections we
            make in our lives and how such connections can impact us. That 's something that interested me and I tried to develop a story around the philosophy."[7] In August 2015, Shinde revealed that she had "almost" completed working on the screenplay.[8]
            Pre-production work began in December 2015. Shinde began working in the story at that time, and she chose Goa and Mumbai as the film's key locations. The production crew consisted primarily of people Shinde had worked with in English Vinglish,
            with the exception of production designer Rupin Suchak—they are film editor Hemanti Sarkar; dialogue team Krishna Hariharan, Gauri Shinde and Kausar Munir; and cinematographer Laxman Utekar.[9] </p>
